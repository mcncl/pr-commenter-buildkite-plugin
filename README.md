# PR Commenter Plugin
A Buildkite plugin written in Go that enables commenting on pull requests that builds are triggered from.

The plugin uses the `/issues` endpoint as that doesn't require a commit SHA or file name in order to post the comment; this comment will post to the `conversation` tab and won't be associated with any file changes.

The plugin has been tested and built using **go 1.20.3**, so it is not guaranteed to work on versions **<1.20.3**.

⚠️ **Note**: this plugin requires the `polyglot-hooks` [experiment](https://github.com/buildkite/agent/blob/main/EXPERIMENTS.md#polyglot-hooks) to be enabled on your agents.

## 👩‍💻 Usage

Add the following to your `pipeline.yml`:

```yaml
    steps:
        command: echo "cool plugin!"
        plugins:
            - pr-commenter#v0.0.1:
                message: "LGTM!"
                secret-name: GITHUB_TOKEN
```

## 📒 Options

### `secret-name` (optional, string)
The environment variable that contains the value of the Discord Webhook URL. If not set, the plugin will try to get the URL from the default configuration.

Default: `GITHUB_TOKEN`

### `message` (optional, string)
The message which should be posted to the PR. This can be a dynamic value, such as `$BUILDKITE_COMMAND`

Default: `[https://buildkite.com/mock-org/cool-pipeline/builds/420#step-id](https://buildkite.com/mock-org/cool-pipeline/builds/420#step-id) exited with code 0`

## 🛠️ Development
### Running the tests
The tests are written using Go's built-in testing package.

Tests can be run using:

```shell
go test -v ./...
```
